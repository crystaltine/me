D at Los Alamos National Laboratory on vectorization of tensor-related operations in the Polybench benchmark suite and other algorithms using PyTorch and Numpy.<br /><br />Developed new graph representations, achieved speed increases of up to 20x for algorithms such as BFS, Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD-2d), and Cholesky decomposition compared to non-vectorized traditional implementations.<br /><br />Gained practical experience in scientific and high-performance computing.",

		"overview": "Floracosm is an exploratory crowdfunding website I made as a personal project, developed between August 2023 to November 2023. The theoretical premise of the website is to provide a minor incentive to donating to charity by allowing users to contribute images to an annual global mural.<br /><br />This was my first large-scale web application that included client, server, and database logic. I learned a lot about the process of full-stack web development and system design - from responsive design to REST APIs to cloud deployment.<br /><br />While I never advertised the project or spread any awareness about it, building Floracosm laid a foundation for me in web development and showed me that I really enjoy it! I'm glad I was able to create a presentable modern website, and reflect positively on my experience.",
