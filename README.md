# crystaltine's React + Vite Template
Basic repo containing prebuilt custom styles and components for my React + Vite (Typescript) web projects
since i often find myself making the same things over and over again.

run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run dev` to start a dev server.

warning most of this code probably sucks,
mainly for my personal use but feel free to use it if you want.
